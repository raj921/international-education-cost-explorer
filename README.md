# International Education Cost Explorer üåçüí∞

## Hey! üëã Welcome to the International Education Cost Explorer!

Are you curious about the financial aspects of studying abroad? This interactive app is designed to help you explore and compare tuition and living costs across various countries, making your study abroad planning a breeze!

## What is this App?

The International Education Cost Explorer provides a clear visual and tabular breakdown of international education expenses:

* **Scatter Plot:** A dynamic graph comparing **Tuition Costs** with **Living Expenses** across different countries. This "fancy word for a graph" helps you visualize cost relationships.
* **Interactive Table:** A clear table listing countries where **tuition costs are above $10,000**, allowing you to focus on significant expenses.
* **Interactive Experience:** All elements are interactive, enabling easy data exploration.

## How to Use It

Get started with the app in a few simple steps:

1.  **Clone or Upload the Project:**
    You can start by creating a new project on the Preswald platform or by downloading this app if it's available on GitHub.

2.  **Upload Your Dataset:**
    Provide the app with your data! Upload a CSV file containing information about tuition costs and living expenses.
    * A sample dataset called `International Education Costs` is typically used to demonstrate the app's capabilities.

3.  **Filter the Data (Automatic):**
    The app intelligently filters your data. It will automatically display only countries where tuition costs are **above $10,000**, helping you concentrate on higher expense regions. Costs less than this amount are filtered out.

4.  **See the Graph:**
    Once your data is filtered, a **scatter plot** will be generated. Each point on this chart represents a country, allowing you to easily see how tuition and living costs compare in different global locations.

5.  **Look at the Table:**
    Below the graph, you'll find an interactive table. This table lists all the countries with tuition costs greater than $10,000. You can scroll through it to conveniently compare expenses across different nations.

## Features
