International Education Cost Explorer
Hey! 👋 Welcome to the International Education Cost Explorer! If you're curious about how much it costs to study abroad, this app helps you explore and compare tuition and living costs from different countries. 🌍💰

What is this app?
This app shows you:

A scatter plot (fancy word for a graph) that compares Tuition Costs with Living Expenses across countries.

A table of countries where tuition costs are above $10,000.

All of this is interactive so you can explore the data easily!

How to use it
1. Clone or Upload the Project
You can start by creating a new project on the Preswald platform or download this app if it’s available on GitHub. Make sure you use Google Chrome for the best experience! 🧑‍💻

2. Upload Your Dataset
Upload a CSV file that has information about tuition costs and living expenses. You can use any dataset you like (maybe from Kaggle or any open data site).

Here, we’re using a sample dataset called International Education Costs that has the info you need.

3. Filter the Data
The app will automatically show countries where tuition costs are above $10,000. It filters out anything less than that so you can focus on the bigger expenses.

4. See the Graph
Once the data is filtered, it will show you a scatter plot. This is a chart where each point represents a country, and the chart helps you see how tuition and living costs compare in different places.

5. Look at the Table
Under the graph, you’ll also see a table that lists all the countries with tuition costs greater than $10,000. You can scroll through and compare them.

Features
